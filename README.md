Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 
My name is Annie. I come from Vietnam. I did my undergrad at Brown in Economics and Development Studies, graduated in May 2020. This past summer I worked at Keystone Strategy, doing economic and strteggy consulting for large tech companies, focusing on digital transformation practices, such as mobile advertising litigation and cloud computing. I'm hope to use the Master in Data Science program to enhance my quantitative skills and pursue a career in strategy consulting after graduation, hoping to focus on technoloy and digital practices as well. Some fun facts. I practice Buddhism, I'm a dancer, and my favorite animals are racoons and red pandas.
